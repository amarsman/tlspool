Reliance on PKCS \#11
=====================

PKCS \#11 is useful for a number of reasons:

-   It separates secret or private keys from the TLS protocol logic.

-   It enables the administrator a range of choices in security levels.

-   It may work on a remote key storage device.

-   It may facilitate cryptographic speed-up.

-   It helps to lift reliance on hardware security â€” or virtual host security.

In client environments, it is somewhat common to see PKCS \#11 implemented.  The
TLS Pool is a first innovator to also pull it into the server environment.
