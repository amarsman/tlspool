# About this Handbook

>   *The intention of the TLS Pool Handbook is to provide the documentation of the
>   TLS Pool in one place, which is clearly structured and supportive of linear
>   reading.  We found that most things had been written down somewhere, but
>   that the TLS Pool represented a sufficiently big paradigm shift that it
>   warranted somewhat longer and more structured documentation.*

The purpose of the TLS Pool Handbook is to give you a complete overview of
what makes you get aquainted with the approach, and use it in everyday practice.
In doing so, it may reference external documentation, but at least it shows the
way that various things are related.

If anything in this Handbook is unclear or does not address your concerns,
and you think it would serve the community if it did,
then please
[file an issue](https://github.com/arpa2/tlspool/issues)
if it has not come up before;
we would like to talk it over and help you find a resolution.
In return, you may of course be asked to
review our updates to the Handbook, so we can learn if your issue has
been sufficiently resolved.

This Handbook was written by Rick van Rein, who also designed and programmed
the original TLS Pool, and who continues to maintain it.  Rick is also the
principal architect of the
[InternetWide Architecture](http://internetwide.org/blog/2016/06/24/iwo-phases.html)
and sees to it that the TLS Pool is well-ingrained with the
[philosphy and goals](http://internetwide.org/about/mission.html)
of this project and other
[ARPA2 development projects](http://arpa2.net).

The
[SteamWorks project](http://steamworks.arpa2.net)
is related to the TLS Pool, albeit loosely.
It is another component of the aforementioned InternetWide / ARPA2 family
of projects.  We use it to subscribe to remote configuration information
sources for the TLS Pool, but it is suitable for doing similar things for
a much, much broader range of purposes.  And that is by design; when we
get to the point where we facilitate
[differentiated hosting](http://internetwide.org/blog/2014/11/19/back-to-hosting.html)
with
[web-enabled backends](http://internetwide.org/blog/2016/02/04/web-ffwd-1-sctp-gssapi.html),
we are going to need it to distribute all sorts of configuration information
form a domain's identity host to any and all plugged-in hosted services.
