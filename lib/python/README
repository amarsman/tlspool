The files in this directory:

py-tlspool.i ( and ../swig-tlspool.i )
	These files map the TLS Pool library to Python.  Use import tlspool
	and describe connections with the class tlspool.Connection.

setup.py
	Uses the Python dist-utils to install the package.  Some day we should
	also add PIP support (but not sure how, by we lay an egg already).

webdemo.py
	A simple demonstration downloading a web page using the TLS Pool port
	to Python.  Assumes IPv6 connectivity.

whoami.py
	A simple web server based on the TLS Pool port to Python.  It will
	tell the client about its accepted identity.  If no identity is
	presented by the client, it will say "You are NOBODY" instead.
